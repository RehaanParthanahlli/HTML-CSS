First watch brocode's Oneshot HTML Video then SupersimpleDivs CSS and HTML Video.

For more info read from the pdf html-css-reference.pdf

Later go through scrimba scrims.

I. Course Introduction and Setup -
• Course Goal: Learning to build websites from a beginner to a professional level, culminating in building youtube.com.
• Course Resources: Access to exercises (more than 100 in total) and an HTML and CSS reference.
• Required Software:
    ◦ Web browser (Google Chrome is recommended for web development).
    ◦ Code editor (VS Code, or Visual Studio Code, is recommended).
• Code Editor Configuration: Installing the Live Server VS Code extension for automatic page reloading, updating VS Code settings for indenting (changing tab size from four spaces to two).

II. HTML Basics (Hypertext Markup Language) -
• Definition and Purpose: HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is the tool used to create websites. It involves giving instructions to a computer step-by-step.
• Creating Files: Creating the first HTML file, ensuring the file name ends with .html.
• Core Concepts:
    ◦ HTML Element: A generic term describing anything displayable on the webpage (e.g., buttons, paragraphs).
    ◦ HTML Tags: The code part that tells the computer what to create.
        ▪ Opening tag (<tag>) and closing tag (</tag>).
        ▪ Content (the text or other elements placed between the tags).
    ◦ Void Elements: Elements that do not require a closing tag (e.g., link, img, input).
• Syntax: The rules for how a coding language should be written.
    ◦ Syntax Quirks: Extra spaces and new lines are essentially ignored by the browser.
    ◦ Indenting code for readability.
• HTML Elements and Tags Introduced:
    ◦ Button (<button>).
    ◦ Paragraph (<p>).
    ◦ Link/Anchor element (<a>).
    ◦ Input element (<input>) (used for creating search boxes/text boxes).
    ◦ Image element (<img>) (used for loading images).
    ◦ Strong element (<strong>).
    ◦ U element (<u>).
    ◦ Span element (<span>) (the most generic text element).
    ◦ Div element (<div>): Stands for division, used as a container or a box.
• Attributes: Syntax that modifies how an element behaves.
    ◦ Attribute syntax (space, name, equal sign, value in quotes).
    ◦ href (Hypertext Reference, determines link destination).
    ◦ target (determines if a link opens in a new tab, value _blank).
    ◦ class (allows labeling HTML elements for targeted CSS styling).
    ◦ src (source, specifies image location).
    ◦ type (specifies input type, e.g., text or checkbox).
    ◦ placeholder (labeling input fields).
• HTML Entities: Using special code to display characters like the middle dot or a check mark, especially symbols that might be confused with HTML tags (e.g., >).

For Deepeer Dive in HTML Watch Bro Code HTML or Notes I have prepared from watching that video in Notebook.

III. CSS Fundamentals (Cascading Style Sheets) -
• Definition and Purpose: Used to style a webpage and change the appearance of HTML elements.
• Setting up CSS:
    ◦ Style Element (<style>): An element placed inside the <head> used to write CSS code directly in the HTML file.
    ◦ Inline Styles: Writing CSS code directly inside the HTML opening tag using the style attribute (used for practice/demonstration).
    ◦ External CSS Files: Moving CSS code into a separate file (e.g., buttons.css, header.css) for better organization.
    ◦ Linking CSS: Using the <link> element inside the <head> to load external CSS files, including using file paths to link files in different folders.
• Syntax:
    ◦ Selector: The word at the front that tells the computer which elements to target.
        ▪ Targeting by element name (e.g., button).
        ▪ Targeting by class name (using a dot, e.g., .subscribe-button).
    ◦ Declaration: Contained within squiggly brackets ({}).
    ◦ Property: Tells the computer what is changing (left of the colon).
    ◦ Value: Tells the computer what the property is changing to (right of the colon).
    ◦ Styles end with a semicolon (;).
    ◦ Targeting multiple elements (separating selectors with a comma).
    ◦ Advanced CSS Selectors (e.g., targeting an element inside another, using a space: .container .inner-element).
• Basic Properties and Values:
    ◦ Color Measurement:
        ▪ Color names (e.g., red, white).
        ▪ RGB (Red, Green, Blue) values (e.g., rgb(200, 0, 0)).
        ▪ Hexadecimal color codes (Hex).
    ◦ background-color.
    ◦ color (for text color).
    ◦ border (removing borders using none).
    ◦ border-color, border-style, border-width.
    ◦ cursor (pointer for hand icon).

IV. Intermediate CSS and Advanced Styling -
• Sizing and Spacing (The Box Model): Determines how much space an element takes up.
    ◦ Margin: Spacing on the outside of the element (e.g., margin-right).
    ◦ Padding: Spacing on the inside of the element (preferred method over fixed height/width).
    ◦ Border.
    ◦ Shorthands: Using single properties like padding, margin, or border to set multiple values (top, right, bottom, left).
• Text Styling:
    ◦ font-family.
    ◦ font-size.
    ◦ font-weight (e.g., bold or numerical values like 500).
    ◦ font-style (e.g., italic).
    ◦ text-align (e.g., center).
    ◦ line-height (spacing between lines).
    ◦ text-decoration (e.g., underline).
    ◦ Placeholder Styling (using the ::placeholder pseudo-class).
    ◦ white-space: nowrap (to prevent text wrapping).
• Interactivity and Effects:
    ◦ Pseudo-classes: Adding extra styles in specific situations.
        ▪ :hover (styles applied when the mouse is over the element).
        ▪ :active (styles applied when the element is clicked).
    ◦ Opacity: opacity property (how see-through an element is, values 0 to 1).
    ◦ Transitions: The transition property (makes style changes smooth, requires defining the property and duration).
    ◦ Shadows: The box-shadow property.
        ▪ Values: horizontal position, vertical position, blur, and color.
        ▪ RGBA Color: rgba (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha), where Alpha is opacity.
        ▪ Inner Shadow: Using inset to place the shadow inside the element.
• Images:
    ◦ width/height (managing dimensions, height adjusts automatically when width is set).
    ◦ object-fit (cover, contain) (determines how an image fits a defined area).
    ◦ object-position (adjusting the visible area of a fitted image).
• CSS Inheritance and Specificity:
    ◦ Inheritance: Certain properties (mostly text-related) set on an outer element (like body) are passed down to inner elements.
    ◦ Specificity: If the same style is set on an element multiple times, the style applied by the more specific selector (e.g., a class selector vs. an element selector) will take priority.

V. Layout Techniques and Display Properties -
• Display Property: Controls how an element is displayed, determining if it appears beside or above/below other elements.
    ◦ Block Elements: Take up the entire line, forcing other elements below them (default for paragraphs, divs).
    ◦ Inline Block Elements: Take up only as much space as needed, allowing elements to appear beside them (default for images, inputs).
    ◦ Inline Elements: Appear within a line of text (e.g., span).
• The Nested Layouts Technique: A fundamental strategy for breaking down complex website designs into a combination of horizontal and vertical layouts.
• CSS Grid: A rigid system for creating two-dimensional layouts (rows and columns).
    ◦ Grid Setup: display: grid (on the container).
    ◦ Columns: grid-template-columns (defines column width/count).
    ◦ Free Space Unit: fr (takes up remaining available space, e.g., 1fr).
    ◦ Gaps: column-gap (space between columns) and row-gap (space between rows).
• CSS Flexbox: A flexible system for creating one-dimensional layouts (rows or columns).
    ◦ Flexbox Setup: display: flex (on the container).
    ◦ Direction: flex-direction (row or column).
    ◦ Free Space Unit: flex: 1 (equivalent to 1fr).
    ◦ Horizontal Alignment: justify-content (center, start, end, space-between).
    ◦ Vertical Alignment: align-items (center, start, end, stretch).
    ◦ Flexibility Control: flex-shrink: 0 (prevents elements from shrinking when space is limited).
• Vertical Alignment: Using the vertical-align: top property on inline-block elements to fix misalignment.

VI. HTML Structure and Organization -
• Proper HTML Structure: The necessary basic structure for every HTML file.
    ◦ <!DOCTYPE html> (declares use of modern HTML version).
    ◦ <html> (contains the entire webpage).
    ◦ <head> (contains non-visible elements like styles and titles).
    ◦ <body> (contains visible elements).
    ◦ <title> (sets text in the browser tab).
• Nesting: Placing elements inside other elements (e.g., <head> and <body> inside <html>).
• File Paths: Locating files (images, CSS) relative to the HTML file (using folder names and /).
• Loading Custom Fonts: Using Google Fonts to load and integrate external fonts (like Roboto) into the website structure via the <head> element.
• Semantic Elements: Elements that function like divs but provide special meaning and structure to screen readers and search engines.
    ◦ Examples: header, nav, main, section.

VII. CSS Position (Fixed, Absolute, Relative) -
• Position Property Overview: Used for specialized layout tasks like stacking elements or fixing elements to the viewport.
• Coordinates: top, bottom, left, right (used to move positioned elements).
    ◦ Stretching elements (by setting opposite coordinates, e.g., left: 0 and right: 0).
    ◦ Using negative values to push elements beyond container edges.
• position: static: The default position (element appears normally).
• position: fixed: Element sticks to the browser window while scrolling (e.g., YouTube header or sidebar).
    ◦ Does not take up space on the page.
    ◦ Requires adding padding to the body element to prevent content overlap.
• position: absolute: Element is positioned relative to the page (moves when scrolling).
• position: relative: Element displays normally, but allows positioned absolute children to be placed relative to it instead of the page.
• Z-Index: Determines which positioned element appears in front (z-index: 100 is higher priority than default 0).
• Key Technique (Absolute inside Relative/Fixed): Used to attach elements to corners or specific points on a container (e.g., video timestamp, notification count).

VIII. Final Project Completion and Review -
• Creating the Sidebar: Using Flexbox with flex-direction: column to align icons and text vertically.
• Tooltips: Creating tooltips that appear on hover using the Position Absolute/Relative technique combined with opacity: 0 (hidden by default) and a :hover pseudo-class (opacity set to 1).
    ◦ pointer-events: none to prevent mouse hover conflicts on the tooltip itself.
• Responsive Design: Adjusting layouts for different screen sizes.
    ◦ Media Queries (@media): Applying specific CSS styles only when certain screen size conditions are met (e.g., max-width, min-width).
• Comments: Using HTML (<!-- Comment -->) and CSS (/* Comment */) comments to document code.
• Next Steps: Recommendation to learn JavaScript
